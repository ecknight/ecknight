### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an applied ecologist interested in how environmental variation across temporal and spatial scales affects the ecology and population trends of wide-ranging species. My motivation in understanding that variation is to inform when and where wildlife conservation efforts will be most effective. I am a Quantitative Ecologist for the [Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute] (https://github.com/ABbiodiversity) and the Boreal Avian Modelling Project (https://github.com/borealbirds).



I believe strongly in collaborative research because it facilitates knowledge transfer, standardizes datasets, and maximizes funding available for conservation. I work towards standardizing protocols and sharing datasets in all my work, and am fortunate to share that collaborative vision with many individuals and organizations.
